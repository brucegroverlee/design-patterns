# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsability Principle
A class should only have one reason to change.

Separation of concerns. Different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems.

## Open-Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.

## Interface Segregation Principle
Don't put too much into an interface. Split into separate interfaces.
YAGNI You Ain't Going to Need It

## Dependency Inversion Principle
High level modules should not depend upon low level ones. Use Abstractions.
